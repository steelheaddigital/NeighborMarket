terms = %[<p>PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. IT CONTAINS IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS.</p>
<p>TERMS OF USE</p>
<p>1. GENERAL</p>
<p>This website provides services, programs and computer servers, including but not limited to local food sourcing, marketing, and forums. (All such services are referred to collectively herein as the â€œServices.") By accessing or using the Services, you are a "user" and you accept and agree to the terms below (the "Terms of Use" or "TOU") as a legal contract between you and the operator of the website. The TOU include and incorporate additional terms ("guidelines") applicable to particular categories or services available on the Services as set forth to users upon access to such categories or services. The website operator may post changes to the TOU at any time, and any such changes will be applicable to all subsequent access to or use of the Services.</p>
<p>If you do not accept and agree to all provisions of the TOU, now or in the future, you may reject the TOU by immediately terminating all access and use of the Services, in which case any continuing access or use of the Services is unauthorized.</p>
<p>You are also required to comply with, and to ensure compliance with, all state, local, and federal laws, ordinances and regulations applicable to your activities on the Services.</p>
<p>The Services is intended and designed for users 13 years of age and older, and access or use by anyone younger is not authorized.</p>
<p>The TOU grant you a limited, revocable, nonexclusive license to access the Services and use the Services, in whole or in part, including but not limited to intellectual property therein, solely in compliance with the TOU.</p>
<p>2. MODERATION</p>
<p>The website operator has the right, but not the obligation, to regulate content (which includes but is not limited to postings, text, code, images, video, binary files, ads, accounts, account information, flags, emails, messages and any other user communications ("content")) posted to, stored on or transmitted via the Services by any user (or any other third party in any manner); to regulate conduct (including but not limited to any authorized or unauthorized access to or use of the Services) by any user (or any other third party in any manner); and to enforce the TOU, for any reason and in any manner or by any means that the website operator, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or appropriate (including but not limited to automated and manual screening, blocking, filtering, exclusion from index pages, exclusion from search results, requiring the use of an application programming interface (API), requiring the use of a bulk posting interface, authorization, verification, and the deletion and/or termination of content, accounts and/or all or any use or access). The website operator may, in its sole discretion and without notice, start, stop or modify any regulation or enforcement measures at any time. Website operator action or inaction to regulate content or conduct or to enforce against any potential violation of the TOU by any user (or any other third party) does not waive the website operator's right to implement or not implement regulation or enforcement measures with respect to any subsequent or similar content, conduct or potential TOU violation.</p>
<p>You also understand and agree that any action or inaction by the website operator or any of its directors, officers, stockholders, employees, consultants, agents or representatives (collectively, "Representatives") to prevent, restrict, redress or regulate content, or to implement other enforcement measures against any content, conduct or potential TOU violation is undertaken voluntarily and in good faith, and you expressly agree that neither the website operator nor any Representative shall be liable to you or anyone else for any action or inaction to prevent, restrict, redress, or regulate content, or to implement other enforcement measures against any content, conduct or potential violation of the TOU.</p>
<p>Although Representatives may moderate content, conduct and TOU compliance on the Services at the website operator's discretion, Representatives have no authority to make binding commitments, promises or representations to anyone that they or anyone else on behalf of the website operator will "take care" of any alleged problem or complaint, or that they or anyone else on behalf of the website operator will otherwise stop, cure or prevent any problem, content, conduct or purported TOU violation from occurring or recurring. Accordingly, you further agree that any representation (written or verbal) by any Representative (or by anyone else acting on behalf of the website operator or by anyone purportedly acting on behalf of the website operator) that the website operator (including but not limited to any Representative, anyone else acting on behalf of the website operator, or anyone purportedly acting on behalf of the website operator) would or would not prevent, restrict, redress or regulate content (including, without limitation, screen, block, moderate, review, remove, terminate, delete, edit or otherwise stop, cure or exclude any content), or to implement other enforcement measures against any content, conduct or potential or purported TOU violation is superseded by this provision and is nonbinding and unenforceable. Specifically, you agree that the website operator, Representatives and anyone else authorized to act on behalf of the website operator shall in no circumstance be liable as a result of any representation that the website operator, a the website operator Representative or anyone else on behalf of the website operator would or would not restrict or redress any content, conduct or potential or purported TOU violation. This paragraph may not be modified, waived or released except by a written agreement, dated and signed by the website operator and dated and signed by the individual or entity to whom the modification, waiver or release is granted.</p>
<p>The website operator also has the right in its sole discretion to limit, modify, interrupt, suspend or discontinue all or any portions of the Services at any time without notice. The website operator and Representatives shall not be liable for any such limitations, modifications, interruptions, suspensions or discontinuance, or any purported losses, harm or damages arising from or related thereto.</p>

You also expressly grant and assign to the website operator all rights and causes of action to prohibit and enforce against any unauthorized copying, performance, display, distribution, use or exploitation of, or creation of derivative works from, any content that you post (including but not limited to any unauthorized downloading, extraction, harvesting, collection or aggregation of content that you post).</p>

You are solely responsible for your interaction with or reliance on any user or user conduct. You must perform any necessary, appropriate, prudent or judicious investigation, inquiry, research and due diligence with respect to any user or user conduct.</p>
<p>You are also responsible for your own conduct and activities on, through or related to the Services, and, if you create an account on the Services, you are responsible for all conduct or activities on, through or by use of your account.</p>
<p>You agree to indemnify and hold the website operator and Representatives harmless from and against any third-party claim, cause of action, demand or damages related to or arising out of your own conduct or activities on, through or related to the Services or the website operator, and related to or arising out of any conduct or activities on, through or by use of your the Services account, if any. This indemnification obligation includes payment of any attorneys' fees and costs incurred by the website operator or Representatives.</p>
<p>POSTING AND ACCOUNTS</p>
<p>This section 4 applies to all uses and users of the Services, unless the website operator has specifically authorized an exception to a particular term for a particular user in a written agreement. The website operator has sole and absolute discretion to authorize or deny any exception or exceptions to the terms in this section 4.</p>
<p>a. Postings</p>
<p>The Services is intended and designed as a local service. Content that is equally relevant to multiple (i.e., more than one) geographic areas should not be posted on the Services.</p>
<p>Users may not circumvent any technological measure implemented by the website operator to restrict the manner in which content may be posted on the Services or to regulate the manner in which content (including but not limited to email) may be transmitted to other users. This prohibition includes, without limitation, a ban on the use of multiple email addresses (created via an email address generator or otherwise); the use of multiple IP addresses (via proxy servers, modem toggling, or otherwise); CAPTCHA circumvention, automation or outsourcing; multiple and/or fraudulent the Services accounts, including phone-verified accounts; URL shortening, obfuscation or redirection; use of multiple phone lines or phone forwarding for verification; and content obfuscation via HTML techniques, printing text on images, inserting random text or content "spinning."</p>
<p>It is expressly prohibited for any third party to post content to the Services on behalf of another. Users must post content only on their own behalf, and may not permit, enable, induce or encourage any third party to post content for them.</p>
<p>It is expressly prohibited to post content to the Services using any automated means. Users must post all content personally and manually through all steps of the posting process. It is also expressly prohibited for any user to develop, offer, market, sell, distribute or provide an automated means to perform any step of the posting process (in whole or in part). Any user who develops, offers, markets, sells, distributes or provides an automated means to perform any step of the posting process (in whole or in part) shall be responsible and liable to the website operator for each instance of access to the Services (by any user or other third party) using that automated means.</p>
<p>Affiliate marketing is expressly prohibited on the Services. Users may not post content or communicate with any the Services user for purposes of affiliate marketing or in connection with any affiliate marketing system, scheme or program in any manner or under any circumstance.</p>
<p>b. Accounts</p>
<p>A user may maintain and use no more than one account, including a telephone or phone-verified account ("PVA"), to post content.

As a limited exception, general purpose Internet search engines and noncommercial public archives will be entitled to access the Services without individual written agreements executed with the website operator that specifically authorize an exception to this prohibition if, in all cases and individual instances: (a) they provide a direct hyperlink to the relevant the Services website, service, forum or content; (b) they access the Services from a stable IP address using an easily identifiable agent; and (c) they comply with the site's robots.txt file; provided however, that the website operator may terminate this limited exception as to any search engine or public archive (or any person or entity relying on this provision to access the Services without their own written agreement executed with the website operator), at any time and in its sole discretion, upon written notice, including, without limitation, by email notice.</p>
<p>Any activities (including but not limited to posting voluminous content) that are inconsistent with use of the Services in compliance with the TOU or that may impair or interfere with the integrity, functionality, performance, usefulness, usability, signal-to-noise ratio or quality of all or any part of the Services in any manner are expressly prohibited.</p>
<p>Any attempt (whether or not successful) to engage in, or to enable, induce, encourage, cause or assist anyone else to engage in, any of the above unauthorized and prohibited access and activities is also expressly prohibited and is a violation of the TOU.</p>
