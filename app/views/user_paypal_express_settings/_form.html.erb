								In order for you to accept online payments through PayPal we first need to verify your account. Enter the email address and names associated with your Paypal account below. We will verify your account with Paypal and you will be redirected to the Paypal site to log in and grant <%= @site_settings.site_name %> permission to process refunds. We need this permission to refund buyers if orders are cancelled or not fulfilled.
							</p>
							<p>
								You must also have a Paypal business account in order to receive online payments. You can <a href="https://www.paypal.com/signup/account">sign up for a new Paypal business account</a> or <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_run-signup-upgrade-link">upgrade your existing account</a> if you need to.
							</p>

								If you recieve errors when trying to confirm your account, please ensure that you have a business account and that the names and email address entered below match those that Paypal has on record for you.
